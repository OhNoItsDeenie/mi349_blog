    <h2>Hi I'm Deenie</h2>
    <p>Im currently a student at Michigan State university, this is for my web 
      design class. I like to play video games, do art, and browse the web. I 
      love all animals, and I am studying computer science. Although if I had to  
    study another subject I would go into zoology </p>
    <p>I dont have any social media with my name and face on it, I'm pretty 
      private so I have my pets to be my masks. </p>
    <p>I love animals, but with this I have some unpopular opinions. I am very 
      passionate about keeping cats indoors. They are an ecological threat that 
      has the biggest advantage, being cute. Cats are the cause of the 
      extinction of hundreds of bird species and kill over a billion birds 
      each year. There is a similar thing going on in the Florida everglades 
      where ball pythons that used to be pets are invasive to the natural 
      ecosystem there, and there are people who catch them. But cats are cute. 
      You can’t do that without people getting really mad. I mourn the cats who 
      would rather go outside with cars and coyotes than stay with a family that 
      brought them in promising a home, and never delivered. What a sad situation 
      all around. Owning a bird makes getting a cat... unlikely. But after Lonnie,
      I would get a cat.</p>

      <p>I also love space. It makes me feel so much smaller and that’s 
        comforting somehow. Theres so many things going on that makes 
        ‘once in a lifetime’ events happen so often. Things that these 
        huge celestial bodies do all the time, but they do it so slowly 
        we can only witness it a couple times in the short window that we 
        are alive. A solar eclipse happens every couple of years but the one 
        that passed nearby recently will only be on this path again in 
        a couple of decades. I watched the eclipse with my dog, and she 
        was there too when the northern lights appeared. We sat on the bench, 
        she was curled up next to me, she doesn’t know why we were out in the 
        cold, but we sat there and watched the night sky. By the time that 
        the next eclipse comes she will be gone and I’m not sure if I will 
        be able to remember these moments, but I am glad I was able to 
        experience this with her. </p>
