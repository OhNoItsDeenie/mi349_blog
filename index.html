        Birds are not like dogs or cats, they are prey animals, and have different needs than those two. When you think of a pet bird you might 
        think of a parrot, but most parrots are undomesticated, not that different from their wild counterparts. Domesticated birds are pigeons
        or chickens. These birds are bred for human use or were bred for human use. With the rise of communication technology pigeons have
        become obsolete and have been abandoned by people in cities. They can be pet on the back, which you cant do on undomesticated parrots. 
        With undomesticated parrots, you can only pet on their head and neck, their bodies are reserved only for mates and touching them there 
        can have the bird mistake you as their mate and will get them hormonal and frustrated.</p>
        <p>
          There are many breeds of both domesticated and undomesticated birds and they all have different needs. I have a green cheek conure, 
          which is undomesticated. I had them for about 3 years now and got them when they were around 6 months. Getting a bird is NOT FOR EVERYONE.
          A lot of species will live a very long time, mine will live up to 30 years, and some will live up to 80. You will have to change your 
          lifestyle drastically, like getting a child wielding a knife. They are loud, destructive, messy, too smart for their own good, and expensive. 
          They will bite your wooden cabinets, wires, you, steal your food, wake you up early, jump on your keyboard and make you lose a game. 
          You have to get rid of all Teflon pans or scented stuff because their lungs are so sensitive and if you donâ€™t catch it by the annual 
          vet visit they can die, and you wont even know because since their prey animals if they are sick then they hide it really well! So yeah, 
          not for everyone. </p>
